\section{Conclusion}
There are many reasons why behavior change is hard: people build up habits over time, behaviors may be tied to addictive substances or activities, behavior is tied to normal daily human experience and context (i.e. smoking more often when with a certain group of individuals or in a particular location).
The full potential of behavioral interventions - particularly JITAIs - will continue unrealized until mechanistic methods of behavior modeling are adopted by the behavior science community.

The presented visualization methods allow for more detailed analysis of how a subjectâ€™s behavior responds to a stimuli over time.
These methods, when combined with a computational modeling approach to understanding human behavior may enable behavioral scientists to formulate more accurate and more application-ready theories, leading to more effective behavioral interventions.
