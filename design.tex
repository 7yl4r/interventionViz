\section{Design Considerations}
%  How is the problem here similar to what has come before?

\subsection{Characteristics of Intervention Datasets}
% What kind of data do they have (or more important starting to get)?

Behavioral scientists with data-overload are becoming increasingly common as wearable sensors increase in popularity.
There no doubt exist many under-utilized datasets with novel contributions to theory waiting to be discovered.

Common features of contemporary behavioral research dataset include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Multiple time-scales - multi-scale measurement at very different frequencies}
	\item{crossover designs - within-subject comparison is the preferred method for gauging efficacy of an intervention}
	\item{high-frequency numerical measures - Accelerometers, ECG, GPS, and much more}
	\item{numerical measures with low frequency - Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) constructs, blood-draws}
	\item{contextual, nominal data at various frequencies - activity classification, location classification, social contexts}
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Use descriptions of our datasets to highlight common characteristics?

I think this is well covered elsewhere (intro especially)
\subsection{Weaknesses in Current Methodology}
	What do they need to know about intervention dynamics?
