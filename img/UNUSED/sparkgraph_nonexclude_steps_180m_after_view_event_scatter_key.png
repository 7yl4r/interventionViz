blue = active
red = sed

types:
A = noceable bump in active over sedentary @ t+60m. Did the avatar cause this?
B = sedentary is consistently higher then active. Are these the people who believe the avatar is copying their behavior in order to remind them that they are being lazy? (thus causing anti-Doppelganger effect?)
-B = active consistently higher than sedentary. Is this the Doppelganger effect?
