Unobtrusive sensing enables individuals to capture a wide range of information about themselves as they go about normal daily life, often at much higher frequencies than previously possible.

In healthcare, the potential for benefit from these datasets is large. In the aggregate, we can use these datasets to understand disease patterns, behaviors, mortality

Unfortunately, the tools do not yet exist to manage, review, and learnf from such data.  Information visualization has a large role to play in enabling such tools.

In the behavioral science domain, access to such tools could fundamentally change the way society's behavioral challengs are attacked.

To be effective, such tools should have several characteristics.

% This paragraph discusses our workflow.  What did we do - step by step - to produce our contributions and reach our conclusions?
In this paper, we derive visualizations that help behavioral scientists gain insight into the short time scale dynamics of health-related events. We focus specifically on the needs of behavioral scientists because many have access to such event datasets but do not yet have the tools to better understand health events, derive and test behavioral theories from them, and ultimately develop more effective and usable behavioral health interventions. The work can be divided into three stages.

\textit{First}, we conduct a user needs analysis with a vested group of stakeholders. We held a data-gathering session at a top-tier behavioral science conference as well as interacted informally with behavioral scientists with specific experience and goals of capturing, analyzing and learning from pervasive health data. We also collected  and analyzed event datasets with short-time scales generated by behavioral scientists. From these interactions and data, we define a set of user goals and tasks as well as broader design considerations for behavioral health event dynamics.  \textit{Second}, based on lessons learned from the user needs analysis, we design visualizations and demonstrate them on three datasets, each of which shows the effect of a physical activity intervention on a user. Two of the datasets were captured from children (ages 11 - ???) as they went about normal daily life, over a multi-day period (3 - 8 days).  The third dataset is a control dataset that mimics the ideal response to a "perfect" physical activity intervention.  \textit{Third}, we derive lessons learned from the proposed visualizations, focusing on 1) what the visualizations do and do not reveal about the data, 2) where there is uncertainty in the meaning of the visualizations, and 3) what scientific questions are not answered by these visualizations and thus require future work.

Despite significant advances in the theory and practice of behavioral science, humans continue make poor behavioral choices on a daily basis, and the reasons for those choices remain, to some extent, uncharted.
The consequences of these daily choices are often insignificant in the moment but over time build up to larger individual and societal problems.
In fact, many of today's greatest health challenges can be mapped back to individual behavioral choices.
A habitual lack of physical activity, poor diet, and smoking is likely to lead to a variety of health problems (e.g., obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic pain, depression), lower quality of life and shortened lifespans \cite{franco2005, dunn2001, yanbaeva2007, ross2000}.
Smoking and lack of exercise are behaviors that clearly affect health and longevity (by increasing the chance of getting cancer, or decreasing the chance of obesity and diabetes), but the general populus seems to lack power over their own habits.
Similar challenges exist outside the realm of personal health.
Academic success is a function of attending class and completing assigned tasks, among other daily behaviors\cite{cooper2006}.
In personal finance, poor day-to-day purchasing decisions can add up to large financial debts\cite{norvilitis2003}.

Behavior change is the art and science of facilitating adoption of new behaviors or abandoning of old behaviors.
Behavior change interventions are particularly important to modern health care systems in developed countries, where preventative behavioral treatment receives little attention from heath care practitioners.


\subsubsection{Why Do Intervention Dynamics Matter?}
The confluence of pervasive sensing, machine learning, network access, and computation facilitates new approaches to guiding behavioral choices.
These systems can detect behaviors and psychological states such as stress\cite{chang2011,lu2012}, physical activity\cite{li2010,emken2012}, social interaction\cite{wyatt2011}, and smoking\cite{sazonov2011}, automatically and, in some cases, in real-time.
These data provide new opportunities for the human-computer interaction (HCI), behavioral science, and other related communities to develop user interfaces for mobile behavioral interventions that help users make better in the moment behavioral choices related to health\cite{klasnja2012,nahum2012}, productivity\cite{ho2005,sohn2005,jewell2011}, personal finance\cite{gallego2012}, and environmental stewardship.\cite{elliott2012}
New methods for evaluating these behavioral interventions remain underexplored and conventional methods of analysis do not offer the level of detail needed to explore the implicit dynamics of just-in-time, interactive, or adaptive interventions.

\subsubsection{Contributions}
% summarize previous work (1 paragraph)
In addition to metrics of success of an intervention, behavioral theorists need tools to help understand the dynamics of behavioral responses to a stimulus.
Due to the lack of a dynamical treatment of behavior within theories, existing models behavior appear inadequate to inform state-of-the-art intervention development \cite{riley2011}.
Applicable methods of intervention analysis and data visualization have been slow to reach behavioral researchers, dramatically limiting their ability to develop of state-of-the-art behavioral theories to address these shortcomings.

% an alternative framing of of our contributions:
\comment{
	- to understand how we can use this type of data to accomplish these domain-specific tasks?
	- to propose new hypotheses and techniques to support these tasks?
	- to propose lessons learned that may apply for similar viz problems.

% highlight why should viz community care!
This work breaks new ground in the application domain, but also provides guidelines for future work bridging the data visualization and behavioral science communities.
