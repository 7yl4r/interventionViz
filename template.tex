%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
With the advent of research-grade wearable sensor suites and increasingly ubiquitous human-computer interface comes the opportunity for a new generation of behavioral theory and behavior change methodologies.
Just-in-time interventions (JITIs) designed to optimize a subjects behavior based on their momentary context are under exploration as a potentially powerful ally for practitioners and commercial behavior health applications.
Analysis of the effect an intervention has on a target behavior, however, is a complex task not well handled by current methods.

In this work we explore the application of aggregated time-series visualization techniques to aid analysis of intervention event effects with emphasis on the dynamics of participant response to intervention.
To highlight the strengths and caveats of the techniques employed, data from two trial studies of physical activity interventions (n=11, n=10) and one empirical control dataset (n=1) are utilized.
The insights presented in this work offer a foundation for future visualization research addressing this problem and as a guide for behavioral scientists in need of more novel methods of analysis.
